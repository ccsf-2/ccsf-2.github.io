                <h2>Cloning Repositories</h2>

		<p> In order to work on projects, you must copy the code of the whole project by copying and downloading the project onto your machine. This is done with the "git clone" command. </p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                fun way to apply your skills to advance projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another format, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across various fields and mediums, and
                this event specially welcomes everyone  to that style
                of collaboration.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                experience, skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
